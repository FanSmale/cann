# ANN-Lite

A lite C++ Artificial Neural Network

#How to use?

Firstly, you have to download libUANN.cpp and libUANN.h (in /UANN)

Then, include them in your program, and fix #include "stdafx.h" in libUANN.cpp to your head file.

To ensure these headfiles are included:

#include <stdio.h>

#include <tchar.h>

#include <malloc.h>

#include <math.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

#include <conio.h>

Finally, see /UANN/UANN.cpp there're 2 unit tests there.

Any question will be reply if you mail to TsingJyujing@163.com

Have a good time.
